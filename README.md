# OilPricePrediction
The ability to predict oil prices would be a valuable asset for business, inventors, and governments. It would allow them to make informed decisions about how to manage their risk and take advantage of potential opportunities.
# Oil Price Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict oil prices based on historical data using machine learning models. Predicting oil prices can have significant implications for various industries, including energy, finance, and transportation. By understanding the trends and patterns in historical oil prices, we can make more informed decisions and mitigate risks associated with price fluctuations.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Data**: Contains historical oil price data in Excel format (`oil_price_data.xlsx`).

- **Models**: This directory holds pre-trained machine learning models used for prediction. The models are saved in HDF5 format (`model_name.h5`).

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

- **Scripts**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

- **Streamlit**: Contains the Streamlit web application(lstm.py) for interactive oil price prediction.
